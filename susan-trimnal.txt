[ ] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independantly research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [ ] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
  git merge abort undos the merge and starts over. Merge conflict can occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when someone that you are working with edits a file and another person deletes the same file. Git can't process it and so it gives you a merge conflict. There are codes to help to resolve that conflict and you might have to go over notes to see how to solve that problem.
  - [ ] Reseach the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch.
  
  - [ ] Reseach the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and ammends previous commits you have made.

- [ ] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. 

- [ ] Research and setup SSH keys with Github, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
